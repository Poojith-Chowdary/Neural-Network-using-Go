# Neural-Network-using-Go
This project involves building a simple neural network in Go without using cgo, which ensures a statically linked binary and highlights Go's native numerical capabilities. The neural network utilizes Gonum matrices for efficient computation and supports flexible architecture with variable numbers of nodes in each layer. By adhering to these guidelines, we demonstrate Go's efficiency and flexibility in machine learning applications without relying on external C libraries.
